4052533369	@bharatberlia Our bit can be to make changes in our schools. Teaching can be more than books. It should more like practical workshops.
4052590546	@bharatberlia e.g. If 'Moral Science' is taught like a practical workshop - it will surely engrave itself in the young minds much better.
4052633007	@bharatberlia Yes all the subjects. "Moral Science" was just an example.

450897019876679680	@xochster Well I had 5 shows starting next week, but at this point I don't even know if any are happening. We shall see.
451115169813659649	@PopCultureMob It could work. It's worked for BSB. But they need to really work at it and want it.
451115388970213379	I just ordered these! #CatLady http://t.co/spP7A91nMh
451119508275867648	@PopCultureMob I working the field I do not it's risky, but it can be done. BSB dont have the type of hype they did back in the day, neither
451119703889833984	@PopCultureMob do NKOTB but BSB is currently on a sold out arena tour and NKs just came off a successful arena tour. They can def do it with
451119887872962560	@PopCultureMob the right team behind them. But right now a break is definitely good for them. They have a negative image in the media a
451120038251331584	@PopCultureMob break will do good to help fix all that. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out for them.
451120485376745473	@PopCultureMob Bahaha you sound like me! Two freaking shows I want to go to and of course it's when I have TW shows *smh*
451120865984659457	@PopCultureMob I agree with that all. When you're hot you have to strike esp when your fanbase is made up mostly of fickle teen. I'm pulling
451121088828022785	@PopCultureMob for them, they're so talented, but I'm also realistic about it all too. I'm just thankful we get to see them before it over.

63479124609613824	@Japanator I actually re-watched the anime again recently. I admit compare to the manga it wasn't as good but I still think it's ok to see
63484364176105472	Doing my math hw
63484480362524672	Hopefully on the upcoming test I'll do better. This last one I got 83%
63484581030014976	And here I thought the 92% was bad -___-ll
63484737330753536	I still can't believe that I got such a score. Especially when I did so well on the practice test
63484834047213568	How is that possible? It doesn't make any sense
63645470265835520	@akunose I'm having problems too. It's so annoying. &gt;.&lt;
63775626204676096	@Tenshin26100 Is that the one when he's in New York?

65581817306169344	@dannychoo I think it depends on the series. There are some series that I don't mind watching the dub but the others that I prefer sub
65586116102852608	@BECFANSBR I'm alright. ^^ Where are you from?
65589725729263616	Trying to organize things here. Hopefully that will make reading the messages I receive easier

65872890997911552	@akunose I guess so. There's not much I can do since I didn't bring any extra assignments to work on.
65874275751575552	@akunose Yeah sometimes I do hw while I wait but to be honest I'm just sick of English D= Yeah that's true.^^
65876787502125056	@akunose XD I'm just frustrated and my teacher always says the same thing to me and then when I get my paper there is a lot wrong with it
65877076368039936	@akunose She says that I'm in the right track to keep going but its hard to feel that way when I get all these red marks on paper &gt;.&lt;
65878249074466816	@akunose No it's a different one. She wanted us to do a book analysis when we only read parts of the beginning and the end -___-
65878460807135234	@akunose I've done book analysis before but I actually read the entire book not parts of it
65878843730313216	@akunose I showed it to her alright and she said that I'll be fine and to relax but I got my score & it was not fine
65880586048385024	@akunose Really?
65880887623024640	@akunose I think she says that so I wouldn't feel discourage as far as I know I'm not the only getting the same comments but its annoying
65881333301395456	*sigh* 9 mins till class. I better make my way there. See you guys later
